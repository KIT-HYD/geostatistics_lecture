# Geostatistics Lecture

Welcome to the online material of this years Geostatistics lecture ([LV 6224805 on Campus Management](https://campus.studium.kit.edu/ev/sX1tBPZfRJe44X27sWBPWg/de))!

In the menu above, you can find presentations, scripts (called notebooks) and exercises. A notebook is a file format, that can be *executed* by the Python package ``jupyter``. In case you install all necessary software on your laptop, you will be able to directly note into the lecture slides, add images, run your own code and find all the additional notes and code samples I putted into the files, but didn't show in lecture. An installation description is given in the [Github repository](https://github.com/KIT-HYD/geostatistics_lecture/blob/master/lectures/README.md).

## Exercises

The exercises are described following the link from the menu. You can download a 
zip archive from that page. **The exercises are not mandatory, but recommended.**
The solutions are also available online, links on the exercises page. 

The exercises are prepared in Octave, an open source alternative to Matlab. They 
should work in Matlab, too. You are also free to solve the exercises in other languages and compare to the solutions. I can help you out in Python, R or C/C++.
