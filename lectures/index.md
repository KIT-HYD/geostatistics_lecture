# Geostatistics Lecture

This folder collects all the lecture notebooks. A notebook is a file format, that can be *executed* by the Python package ``jupyter``. In case you install all necessary software on your laptop, you will be able to directly note into the lecture slides, add images, run your own code and find all the additional notes and code samples I putted into the files, but didn't show in lecture. An installation description is given in the [Github repository](https://github.com/KIT-HYD/geostatistics_lecture/blob/master/lectures/README.md).

Instead of installing all that stuff, you are also free to download only the notebooks ending on ``.html``. These are static versions of the real notebooks that can also be viewed in the browser, but cannot be changed. Therefore, you don't need to install anything.

The slides and notebooks are also available as online versions in the menu above.
