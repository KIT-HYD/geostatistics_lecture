# Lectures

This folder collects all the lecture notebooks. A notebook is a file format, that can be *executed* by the Python package ``jupyter``. In case you install all necessary software on your laptop, you will be able to directly note into the lecture slides, add images, run your own code and find all the additional notes and code samples I putted into the files, but didn't show in lecture. An installation description is given at the end of this document.

Instead of installing all that stuff, you are also free to download only the notebooks ending on ``.html``. These are static versions of the real notebooks that can also be viewed in the browser, but cannot be changed. Therefore, you don't need to install anything.

## Installing jupyter

There are a few things you'll have to do to run the notebooks on your own computer. You need Python, Octave and a few additional Python packages. I tried to simplify the installation process as much as possible.
