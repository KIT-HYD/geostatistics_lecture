# Geostatistics lecture

## Introduction
You can use this repository to solve all tasks and exercises of our 'Geostatistics' ([LV 6224805 on Campus Management](https://campus.studium.kit.edu/ev/2HKQRqFeSTu15TtPGocP-Q/de)) lecture. Each exercise/task is contained in one folder with at least a `README.md` file in it, which contains more information. 

`.md` is the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format. This is basically a text format and can be opened by every text editor. To render the contained styling open these files either here on github or with a specialized editor like [Typora](https://typora.io/).

The solved tasks can be submitted by one of the following ways:

* Directly here on github, by sending a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). This is the prefered way   and will be explained in the first lecture.
* Upload the solutions on [ILIAS](https://ilias.studium.kit.edu/)
* Send them via mail to the instructors

## Get the files

For Windows, there is a [Desktop Application](https://desktop.github.com/) to manage a git repository. 
You can download the files from this site using the green button *clone or download*. There is also a
possibility to download the files as a ZIP archive.

The perefered way is to clone the full repository with the git cli:

```bash
git clone https://github/kit-hyd/geostatistics_lecture.git
```
