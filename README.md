# Geostatistics lecture

You can use this repository to solve all tasks and exercises of our 'Geostatistics' ([LV 6224805 on Campus Management](https://campus.studium.kit.edu/ev/2HKQRqFeSTu15TtPGocP-Q/de)) lecture. Each exercise/task is contained in one folder with at least a `README.md` file in it, which contains more information. 

`.md` is the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format. This is basically a text format and can be opened by every text editor. To render the contained styling open these files either here on github or with a specialized editor like [Typora](https://typora.io/).

The solved tasked can be submitted by one of the following ways:

* Directly here on github, by sending a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). This is the prefered way   and will be explained in the first lecture.
* Upload the solutions on [ILIAS](https://ilias.studium.kit.edu/)
* Send them via mail to the instructors
