## Description

Use the files `sample_data.txt` and `sample_positions.txt` given above for this project. 
You should be well familiar with these files from lecture. The objective of this project is to 
use the algorithm as implemented in lecture and test other models and estimators.

There are more estimators for semi-variance available and other models to describe the 
spatial model. How does this impact the result?
Try at least the Cressie-Hawkins estimator, the spherical, exponential and Matérn model. 
You will need a visual comparison **and** describe where differences are.
