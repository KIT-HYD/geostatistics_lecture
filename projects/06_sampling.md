## Description

In the folder given above, you can find all 500 random fields, that were used to create the time series
as presented in the lecture. Read a bit on sampling. What kind of strategies are available?
Implement at least three different strategies (you can include the one I used as well) and test 
how they influence the variogram and kriging result in dependence of sampling size.

**Note:** You are free to line up with project 2 and 3, if anyone is working on that, and use their 
implementations on other model functions and objective functions if you find that to be useful here.
