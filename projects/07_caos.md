## Description

During the past few years, a unique dataset was collected in the Attert Catchment in Luxemburg
in the project CAOS - Catchments as organized systems.
This dataset also includes soil moisture measurements at different depths in three different geologies.
You will be provided with daily means of one year and metadata in case you chose this projct.

Make yourself familiar with the sampling strategy, by studying the metadata and plotting the positions.
How can you apply kriging here? Try to develop meaningful spatial models of the observations.

Work the following questions into your report:

* How do spatial models compare between an annual mean and monthly mean soil moistures?

In a recent study we proposed a segmentation algorithm to indentify periods of spatial similarity in 
time series. For the given year the period durations where:

- 1. period: 42  days
- 2. period: 135 days
- 3. period: 136 days
- 4. period: remaining time (without any clear results)

How do the models compare to the other results?
