# Projects

There are a set of projects available that will be used for assignment.

## Project files

In each project description you will find a statement about the number of people that can work 
on the project:

* _individual work_: You have to solve the project on your own
* _1 - 3_: These projects are solvable alone, but that might be a lot of work. So you can group up to 3 people
* _>3_: These projects are more work and you should at least be three

Each project files includes a statement about the difficulty. In case you choose a `very easy` or 
`easy` project, more focus will be put on the actual report for grading.

## Reports

You will be graded by an **individual** report. Even if you work in groups, the reports are individual.
For group work, the reports can contain a shared data description, method description etc.

There is no specific page number required. The shorter the better. Most project should fit into 4 pages.
You are free to hand in supplements, like code, which will then also be graded. The more difficult a 
project was, the more supplements will be considered for grading.

The grades are given for the report (and supplements). If you were not able to solve a project by 100%, 
don't worry. The report (eg. focuing on what went wrong) can still be great.

Please follow a typical scientific structure and choose scientific language. From the report it should become
obvious what you did, what the results are, how you assess and discuss your results and your conclusions.
If you rely on other works/materials/methods, please **cite** accordingly.

## Getting help

Please do not mail me. I tend to oversee mails and I don't want to answer the same questions over and over again.
 
First of all, you can use MS Teams. There, do not send me a private message, but post into one of the channels. 
Everyone can help and answers might be helpful for everyone.

The most effective way to work on projects is to create a git repository. They can be private for free
since a few weeks (eg. the CAOS project, because of the data). Invite me into the project (@mmaelicke)
and submit changes to your codebase as Pull requests. Then you can assign other project members, or me, 
as a reviewer. This way I can effectively help, while you are working.

And: please do not mail.
