# Geostatistics lecture

## Introduction
You can use this page to solve all tasks and exercises of our 'Geostatistics' ([LV 6224805 on Campus Management](https://campus.studium.kit.edu/ev/sX1tBPZfRJe44X27sWBPWg/de)) lecture. Each exercise/task is contained in one folder with at least a `README.md` file in it, which contains more information. 

The exercises in this directory are not mandatory, but it is highly recommended 
to solve them to be able to pass the class. Note that this folder only contains
the exercises. Lecture material can be found at: 
[https://kit-hyd.github.io/geostatistics_lecture](https://kit-hyd.github.io/geostatistics_lecture)

`.md` is the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format. This is basically a text format and can be opened by every text editor. To render the contained styling open these files either here on github or with a specialized editor like [Typora](https://typora.io/).

## Get the files

**If you just want to download the exercise material follow 
[this link](https://kit-hyd.github.io/geostatistics_lecture/static/exercises.zip).**

You can also *clone* the whole material, including the lectures here from Github.
For Windows, there is a [Desktop Application](https://desktop.github.com/) to manage a git repository. 
You can download the files as a [ZIP archive](https://github.com/KIT-HYD/geostatistics_lecture/archive/master.zip).

The perefered way is to clone the full repository with the git cli:

```bash
git clone https://github/kit-hyd/geostatistics_lecture.git
```

If you want to run the lecture notebooks on your own computer, 
please read the [instructions](https://github.com/KIT-HYD/geostatistics_lecture/tree/master/lectures) carefully first.
